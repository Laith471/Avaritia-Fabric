Do you wish there was a way to make the process take significantly longer? Do you love GregTech, but wish it weren't so short? Do you sit down on your chest full of Galgadorian Drills and wish there was a mod that didn't just hand things to you on a silver platter?\n\n \n\nThis might be the mod for you!",
